This is a Python script that defines a class called "Person" that represents a person. The Person class has two properties: a name property and an age 
property, both of which are initialized using the init method.

Additionally, the Person class has a method called "say_hello" that prints a greeting message to the console, using formatted string literals to include 
the person's name and age in the message.

The code also demonstrates how to create a new instance of the Person class, passing in the person's name and age as arguments to the constructor. 
Finally, the say_hello method is called on the person1 instance, which prints out the greeting message to the console.
