This is a JavaScript file that defines a class called "Person" that represents a person. The Person class has two properties: a name property and an age 
property, both of which are passed to the constructor method as parameters and are assigned to the class properties.
Additionally, the Person class has a method called "sayHello" that logs a greeting message to the console, using template literals to include the person's 
name and age in the message.
The code also demonstrates how to create a new instance of the Person class using the "new" keyword and passing in the person's name and age as arguments 
to the constructor method. Finally, the sayHello method is called on the person1 instance, which logs the greeting message to the console.
This code showcases the fundamentals of object-oriented programming in JavaScript, including the creation of classes, properties, and methods using class 
syntax. It also demonstrates how to create instances of a class and call methods on those instances. This code can serve as a good starting point for 
learning JavaScript and object-oriented programming concepts in JavaScript.
