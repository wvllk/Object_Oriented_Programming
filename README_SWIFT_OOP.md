This file is a Swift code file that defines a class called "Person" that represents a person. The Person class has two properties: a name property of 
type String and an age property of type Int.
The class also has an initializer method that takes in two parameters - name and age - and sets the values of the class properties to the values passed in.
Additionally, the Person class has a method called "sayHello" that prints out a greeting message that includes the person's name and age.
The code also demonstrates how to create a new instance of the Person class, passing in the person's name and age as arguments to the initializer method. 
Finally, the sayHello method is called on the person1 instance, which prints out the greeting message.
